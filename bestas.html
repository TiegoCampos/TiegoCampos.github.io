                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>The Asylum Demon was created by the Bed of Chaos and ensures that only the most Undead are able to escape the Northern Undead Asylum. It is first encountered when approaching the graveyard at the Undead Asylum whereupon it jumps down from the roof of the building to attack the player.</p>
                    <p>The Asylum Demon was likely put in place by Gwyn and his descendants to test any Undead who would hope to escape the Asylum. Gwyn and his descendants do not want just any Undead to escape, they want a powerful Undead who would be able to replace Gwyn as fuel for the fire.</p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>In a futile attempt to prolong the Age of Fire, the Witch of Izalith tried to recreate the First Flame. The ritual was a failure and it instead created a distorted being of chaos and fire. Its power formed a bed of life which consumed the witch and msot of her followers. The Bed of Chaos is located in a chamber below Lost Izalith, guarded by a Daughter of Chaos.</p>
                    <p>The Bed takes the form of a huge, gnarled tree, with a humanoid shape. It attacks with two arm-like limbs, and eventually sprouts flaming limbs that resemble wings from an apparition on its back, with which it also attacks. An insect-like creature is found below the tree-shaped creature.</p>
                    <p>The Bed of Chaos resembles a uterus, which is a recurring theme in games directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki.
					Each of the side domes is an ovary, then the player crawls into the cervical canal to kill the fetus in the womb. All other demons are said to be born of the Bed of Chaos.</p>

                    <p>The Bell Gargoyles are the guardians of the first Bell of Awakening that is found in the tower atop the new church. The gargoyles are magically created creatures that oppose any undead who attempt to ring the bell, fighting any who attempt to cross the roof to gain access to the belltower.</p>
                    <p>It seems likely that they are a creation of the gods, as gargoyles can also be found in Anor Londo. In this case, it seems likely that they are meant as a test to prove the worth of any who would try and claim the title of Chosen Undead.</p>
                    <p>They wield large spears and breathe fire.</p>

When the Chaos Flame was created he was transfigured into a gigantic tentacled creature and this emphasized his already crippling physical condition such that he now constantly oozes lava. His one comfort in life is watching over the grave of one of his sisters.</p>

					<p>He has created an illusion of his sister Gwynevere and all the guardian sentinels in the city's palace. His duty as a god is to execute sinners, and is helped by his followers with the covenant of the Blade of the Darkmoon. He guards his father's honorary tomb in Anor Londo.</p>

					<p>The description of his Crown of the Dark Sun reads:</p>

					<p>Crown of the Dark Sun Gwyndolin, protector of the forsaken city of Anor Londo.</p>
					<p>This crown of the gods demands faith immeasurable of its wearer, but it is imbued with Darkmoon power that enhances all magic. The image of the sun manifests Gwyndolin's deep adoration of the sun.</p>

					<p>It is known that, when the Chaos engulfed the Witch of Izalith and her followers, these fire sorceries were lost, and that the pyromancies were created.</p>
					<p>This demon was the first one to be mutated by the chaos flame, probably as his status as a master of the original fire arts granted him a close position to the Witch.</p>

                    <p>Gravelord Nito, first of the Dead, is one of the four beings who found the Souls of Lords within the flame, and defeated the everlasting dragons. He acts as a god of death and disease, and is the master of the Gravelord Servant covenant.</p>
					<p>After the war with the dragons, Nito presumably returned to the Tomb of the Giants, where he slumbers to this day as keeper of a Lord Soul. Travelers brave enough to find their way into his tomb can pay their respects and become a Gravelord Servant.</p>
					<p>At one point Pinwheel stole the power of Nito. This power was also sought after by Occultists who wished to destroy the other lords using the power of Nito. These events are considered ancient history that fall in a timeline between the fall of Oolacile and the Chosen Undead's arrival.</p>
					<p>It is interesting to note Nito's role as the giver and bringer of death seems to put him in direct opposition to those who are undead.</p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>At the dawn of the Age of Fire, Gwyn discovered a Lord Soul and thus became the Lord of Sunlight alongside three other Lords. His Lord Soul granted him the power of the sun and lightning, and Gwyn helped defeat the Everlasting Dragons; his "mighty [lightning] bolts peeled apart their stone scales".</p>
					<p>Thousands of years ago, the First Flame began to fade. The Witch of Izalith attempted to recreate the first flame, but failed and the flame engulfed and corrupted her and most of her followers, creating the Bed of Chaos and the Chaos Flame. Gwyn waged war against the demons at one point, but the attempt failed.</p>
					<p>Gwyn was also known to hunt dragons and wyverns later on and had Four Knights. The dragon trophies can be found all around on the walls in Anor Londo. He bequeathed parts his Lord Soul to the Four Kings of New Londo, and Seath the Scaleless -as well as a dukedom to the latter.</p>
					<p>Ultimately, Gwyn left Anor Londo to travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to rekindle it and thus prolong the Age of Fire. He brought half of his knights with him, while the rest stayed behind to guard Anor Londo. After successfully linking the fire, the First Flame burned Gwyn and his knights, reducing him to the Lord of Cinder, though his soul remained powerful.</p>
					<p>Gwyn's army of knights that accompanied him to the Flame were transformed into by the Chaos Flame, becoming the Black Knights. Gwyn had three children: Gwynevere, Gwyndolin, and his firstborn, whose name is unknown due to the loss of his deity status.</p>
					<p>Gwyn's friend, Havel the Rock, was a general over his own warriors, which were presumably part of Gwyn's army.</p>

                    <p>The Iron Golem was created by the gods to guard Sen's Fortress thereby denying access to any seeking entrance to Anor Londo. It has slain countless heroes in their attempts to reach the city of the gods.</p>
                    <p>It consists of a massive set of heavy iron armour. The core of the Iron Golem was created by the gods when they fused ancient dragon bones with the power of the soul. Without its core, the Iron Golem is just a hunk of armour.</p>
                    <p>Both Tarkus and possibly Lautrec likely defeated the Golem, but by its very nature it can be reset, which is perfect for training with - the supposed purpose of Sen's Fortress.</p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Knight Artorias, also known as the 'Abysswalker', was one of the four knights of Gwyn. There is a possibility that he was present during the fall of New Londo as he traveled to New Londo when the Four Kings fell to the dark and hunted the Darkwraiths. To do this, he made a covenant with the beasts of the Abyss (possibly Kaathe or Frampt) that allowed him to traverse it.</p>
                    <p>When Oolacile fell to the dark, he was awarded the //Silver Pendant for facing the Abyss, an ancient treasure of Anor Londo that "deflects the Dark of the Abyss, especially in its magic forms".</p>
                    <p>He traveled to Oolacile but was defeated by Manus. Artorias sacrificed himself to protect his wolf companion Sif, using his greatshield to raise a barrier around the pup. He fled from Manus, but his exposure to the abyss overcame him and he fell to its corruption. By the time the the Chosen Undead arrives, it is too late. Artorias is by then completely overtaken by the corruption of the Abyss and attacks the player.</p>
                    <p>His grave, marked with his greatsword, is placed at the Oolacile Sanctuary area (later known as the Darkroot Garden) and is guarded by Sif, Alvina's clan of Forest Hunters, and possibly also Lord's Blade Ciaran.</p>

                    <p>While something of a demon in appearance when encountered by the player, Manus was in fact once human. He became the Father of the Abyss when his humanity went wild, but it is not known what caused this. According to both Marvelous Chester and Hawkeye Gough, an unidentified Primordial Serpent (whether it was Kaathe or Frampt is uncertain) urged the citizens of Oolacile to delve in the dark of the Abyss, where they awoke this primordial man. Upon awakening, he raged and set to expand his domain while seeking out his precious Broken Pendant. His influence consumed the citizens of Oolacile, whose humanity went wild in turn, mutating them into ghastly creatures. Its inhabitants gone mad, Oolacile was left to fall to ruin. Nothing remains in present day to mark the passing of Oolacile, save Dusk.</p>
                    <p>When the player finds half of his pendant, Manus reaches out through time and space to reacquire it, taking the player to Oolacile in the process. He also takes Marvelous Chester in the same manner, who may have found the other half of the pendant in another time. While this pendant obviously held some deep meaning to Manus, but it is long since lost to time.</p>
                    <p>Sometime before the player's arrival into the past, Artorias and his young wolf Sif faced off against Manus. However, Manus overpowered them. Artorias sacrificed himself to protect his compatriot. Manus, having defeated Artorias, corrupted him against his will.</p>
                    <p>After his defeat, his soul split apart and became fragmented. Eventually some of these soul fragments became self-aware and formed into their own entities.</p>
                    <p>'Manus' is the Latin word for 'hand'.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, Manu is a term found with various meanings in different mythologies of Hinduism. In early texts, it refers to the archetypal man, or to the first man, progenitor of humanity. In later texts, Manu is the title or name of the head of mythical dynasties that begin with each cyclic aeon when the universe is born anew.</p>

                    <h1>Seath the Scaleless</h1>
                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Seath is a white dragon without scales, granted the title of Duke by Lord Gwyn for his assistance in defeating the Everlasting Dragons. Seath was also given a fragment of a Lord Soul along with his dukedom. As Duke, Seath became obsessed with his experiments and research. He amassed countless tomes and was eventually driven mad by the research. He had also acquired the Primordial Crystal; a sacred treasure pillaged when he turned on the ancient dragons, granting him immortality and making him a true undead.</p>
                    <p>According to the description of the Moonlight Greatsword, obtained by cutting off his tail, Seath is said to be the grandfather of Sorcery. This makes him the object of Big Hat Logan's obsession. Seath's creations include the Pisaca, Moonlight Butterfly, Crystal Golems and Crystal Ember:</p>
                    <p>Soul of the Moonlight Butterfly: The butterfly's soul is a creation of Seath the Scaleless. His servants, the Channelers, assists him in his research by kidnapping women to be experimented upon:</p>
                    <p>Robe Of The Channelers: Robe of the Channelers, sorcerers that serve Seath the Scaleless. Even after the onset of Seath's madness, the "snatchers" as they were often called, ventured to far lands to find suitable human specimens. The Pisaca are the result of one of these experiments. The humanity that drops from them confirms that they were once human. Two non-hostile ones are found in the tower, crying, who are implied to have been Gwynevere's maidens, for they drop the Soothing Sunlight and Bountyful Sunlight miracles:</p>
                    <p>Special miracle granted to the maidens of Gwynevere, Princess of the Sun. Seath is said to be blind, and it is implied by the Six Eyed Helm Of The Channelers description that he sees through his Channelers. In this way his influence stretches across Lordran and other lands: Helm of the Channelers, sorcerers that serve Seath the Scaleless. The six eyes arranged in two vertical columns compensate for Seath's lack of sight. The Vinheim Dragon School is likely founded upon the following or worshipping of Seath and his sorceries.</p>
